# Repo for Unity Game "Press To Play"

This is my repo for the game I submitted to GGJ2024 - Make Me Laugh. Playable on [Itch.io](https://lolxu.itch.io/press-to-play)
The game is some good arcade fun with some interesting twists with the start and end button. 

Made in Unity under 48 hours. Structured code and followed OOP principles!
